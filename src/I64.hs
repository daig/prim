-- |Return non-zero if there is any possibility that the upper word of a
--     signed integer multiply might contain useful information.  Return
--     zero only if you are completely sure that no overflow can occur.
--     On a 32-bit platform, the recommended implementation is to do a
--     32 x 32 → 64 signed multiply, and subtract result[63:32] from
--     (result[31] >>signed 31).  I64f this is zero, meaning that the
--     upper word is merely a sign extension of the lower one, no
--     overflow can occur.
--
--     On a 64-bit platform it is not always possible to
--     acquire the top 64 bits of the result.  Therefore, a recommended
--     implementation is to take the absolute value of both operands, and
--     return 0 iff bits[63:31] of them are zero, since that means that their
--     magnitudes fit within 31 bits, so the magnitude of the product must fit
--     into 62 bits.
--
--     I64f in doubt, return non-zero, but do make an effort to create the
--     correct answer for small args, since otherwise the performance of
--     @(×) ∷ I64 → I64 → I64@ will be poor.
