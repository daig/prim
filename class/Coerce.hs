 -- * cast#
 -- | The implementation of unsafeCoerce is surprisingly subtle.
 -- This Note describes the moving parts.  You will find more
 -- background in MR !1869 and ticket #16893.
 -- 
 -- The key challenge is this.  Suppose we have
 --
 -- @
 --    case sameTypeRep t1 t2 of
 --       False -> blah2
 --       True  -> ...(case (x |> UnsafeCo @t1 @t2) of { K -> blah })...
 -- @
 -- 
 -- The programmer thinks that the unsafeCoerce from 't1' to 't2' is safe,
 -- because it is justified by a runtime test (sameTypeRep t1 t2).
 -- It used to compile to a cast, with a magical 'UnsafeCo' coercion.
 -- 
 -- But alas, nothing then stops GHC floating that call to unsafeCoerce
 -- outwards so we get
 --
 -- @
 --    case (x |> UnsafeCo @t1 @t2) of
 --      K -> case sameTypeRep t1 t2 of
 --              False -> blah2
 --              True  -> ...blah...
 -- @
 -- 
 -- and this is utterly wrong, because the unsafeCoerce is being performed
 -- before the dynamic test. This is exactly the setup in #16893.
 -- 
 -- The solution is this:
 -- 
 --   * In the library Unsafe.Coerce we define:
 --
 -- @ 
 --      unsafeEqualityProof :: forall k (a :: k) (b :: k).
 --                             UnsafeEquality a b
 -- @ 
 --
 --   * It uses a GADT, Unsafe.Coerce.UnsafeEquality, that is exactly like :~:
 --
 -- @ 
 --     data UnsafeEquality (a :: k) (b :: k) where
 --       UnsafeRefl :: UnsafeEquality a a
 -- @ 
 --
 --   * We can now define Unsafe.Coerce.unsafeCoerce very simply:
 --
 -- @ 
 --    unsafeCoerce :: forall (a :: Type) (b :: Type) . a -> b
 --    unsafeCoerce x = case unsafeEqualityProof @a @b of
 --                       UnsafeRefl -> x
 -- @ 
 --
 --   There is nothing special about unsafeCoerce; it is an
 --   ordinary library definition, and can be freely inlined.
 -- 
 -- Now our bad case can't happen.  We'll have
 --
 -- @
 --      case unsafeEqualityProof @t1 @t2 of
 --         UnsafeRefl (co :: t1 ~ t2) -> ....(x |> co)....
 -- @ 
 --
 -- and the (x |> co) mentions the evidence 'co', which prevents it
 -- floating.
 -- 
 -- But what stops the whole (case unsafeEqualityProof of ...) from
 -- floating?  Answer: we never float a case on a redex that can fail
 -- outside a conditional.  See Primop.hs,
 -- Note [Transformations affected by can_fail and has_side_effects].
 -- And unsafeEqualityProof (being opaque) is definitely treated as
 -- can-fail.
 -- 
 -- While unsafeCoerce is a perfectly ordinary function that needs no
 -- special treatment, Unsafe.Coerce.unsafeEqualityProof is magical, in
 -- several ways
 -- 
 -- (U1) unsafeEqualityProof is /never/ inlined.
 -- 
 -- (U2) In CoreToStg.Prep, we transform
 --        case unsafeEqualityProof of UnsafeRefl g -> blah
 --       ==>
 --        blah[unsafe-co/g]
 -- 
 --      This eliminates the overhead of evaluating the unsafe
 --      equality proof.
 -- 
 --      Any /other/ occurrence of unsafeEqualityProof is left alone.
 --      For example you could write
 --
 --      @
 --          f :: UnsafeEquality a b -> blah
 --          f eq_proof = case eq_proof of UnsafeRefl -> ...
 --      @
 --
 --     (Nothing special about that.)  In a call, you might write
 --
 --     @
 --          f unsafeEqualityProof
 --      @
 -- 
 --     and we'll generate code simply by passing the top-level
 --     'unsafeEqualityProof' to f.  As (U5) says, it is implemented as
 --     UnsafeRefl so all is good.
 -- 
 --     NB: Don't discard the case if the case-binder is used
 --
 --     @
 --            case unsafeEqualityProof of wild_xx { UnsafeRefl ->
 --            ...wild_xx...
 --     @
 --
 --         That rarely happens, but see #18227.
 -- 
 -- (U3) In GHC.CoreToStg.Prep.cpeRhsE, if we see
 --
 --  @
 --        let x = case unsafeEqualityProof ... of
 --                  UnsafeRefl -> K e
 --        in ...
 --  @
 -- 
 --      there is a danger that we'll go to
 --
 --      @
 --         let x = case unsafeEqualityProof ... of
 --                   UnsafeRefl -> let a = e in K a
 --         in ...
 --       @
 -- 
 --      and produce a thunk even after discarding the unsafeEqualityProof.
 --      So instead we float out the case to give
 --
 --      @
 --         case unsafeEqualityProof ... of { UnsafeRefl ->
 --         let a = e
 --             x = K a
 --         in ...  }
 --      @
 --
 --      Floating the case is OK here, even though it broadens the
 --      scope, because we are done with simplification.
 -- 
 -- (U4) Ditto GHC.Core.Unfold.inlineBoringOk we want to treat
 --      the RHS of unsafeCoerce as very small; see
 --      Note [Inline unsafeCoerce] in that module.
 -- 
 -- (U5) The definition of 'unsafeEqualityProof' in Unsafe.Coerce
 --      looks very strange:
 --
 --      @
 --         unsafeEqualityProof = case unsafeEqualityProof @a @b of
 --                                  UnsafeRefl -> UnsafeRefl
 --      @
 -- 
 --      It looks recursive!  But the above-mentioned CoreToStg
 --      transform will change it to
 --
 --      @
 --         unsafeEqualityProof = UnsafeRefl
 --      @
 --
 --      And that is exactly the code we want!  For example, if we say
 --
 --      @
 --         f unsafeEqualityProof
 --      @
 --
 --      we want to pass an UnsafeRefl constructor to f.
 -- 
 --      We turn off strictness analysis in this module, otherwise
 --      the strictness analyser will mark unsafeEqualityProof as
 --      bottom, which is utterly wrong.
 -- 
 -- (U6) The UnsafeEquality data type is also special in one way.
 --      Consider this piece of Core
 --
 --      @
 --         case unsafeEqualityProof @Int @Bool of
 --            UnsafeRefl (g :: Int ~# Bool) -> ...g...
 --      @
 -- 
 --      The simplifier normally eliminates case alternatives with
 --      contradicatory GADT data constructors; here we bring into
 --      scope evidence (g :: Int~Bool).  But we do not want to
 --      eliminate this particular alternative!  So we put a special
 --      case into DataCon.dataConCannotMatch to account for this.
 -- 
 -- (U7) We add a built-in RULE
 --
 -- @
 --        unsafeEqualityProof k t t  ==>  UnsafeRefl (Refl t)
 -- @
 --
 --      to simplify the case when the two types are equal.
 -- 
 -- (U8) The is a super-magic RULE in GHC.base
 --
 -- @
 --          map coerce = coerce
 -- @
 --
 --      (see Note [Getting the map/coerce RULE to work] in GHC.Core.SimpleOpt)
 --      But it's all about turning coerce into a cast, and unsafeCoerce
 --      no longer does that.  So we need a separate map/unsafeCoerce
 --      RULE, in this module.
 -- 
 --      Adding these RULES means we must delay inlinine unsafeCoerce
 --      until the RULES have had a chance to fire; hence the INLINE[1]
 --      pragma on unsafeCoerce.  (Side note: this has the coincidental
 --      benefit of making the unsafeCoerce-based version of the `reflection`
 --      library work -- see #21575.)
 -- 
 -- There are yet more wrinkles
 -- 
 -- (U9) unsafeCoerce works only over types of kind `Type`.
 --      But what about other types?  In Unsafe.Coerce we also define
 -- 
 --       @
 --       unsafeCoerceUnlifted :: forall (a :: T UnliftedRep)
 --                                      (b :: T UnliftedRep).
 --                               a -> b
 --       unsafeCoerceUnlifted x
 --         = case unsafeEqualityProof @a @b of
 --               UnsafeRefl -> x
 --       @
 -- 
 --      and similarly for @unsafeCoerceAddr@, @unsafeCoerceInt@, etc.
 -- 
 -- (U10) We also want a representation-polymorphic unsafeCoerce#:
 -- 
 --        @
 --        unsafeCoerce# :: forall (r1 :: Rep) (r2 :: Rep)
 --                         (a :: T r1) (b :: T r2).
 --                         a -> b
 --        @
 -- 
 --       This is even more dangerous, because it converts between two types
 --       *with different runtime representations*!!  Our goal is to deprecate
 --       it entirely.  But for now we want it.
 -- 
 --       But having it is hard!  It is defined by a kind of stub in Unsafe.Coerce,
 --       and overwritten by the desugarer.  See Note [Wiring in unsafeCoerce#]
 --       in Desugar.  Here's the code for it
 --
 --       @
 --         unsafeCoerce# x = case unsafeEqualityProof @r1 @r2 of UnsafeRefl ->
 --                           case unsafeEqualityProof @a  @b  of UnsafeRefl ->
 --                           x
 --       @
 --
 --       Notice that we can define this kind-/heterogeneous/ function by calling
 --       the kind-/homogeneous/ unsafeEqualityProof twice.

 --             (x |> (GRefl :: a ~# (a |> TYPE co1)) ; co2)
 -- @
 -- 
 -- It looks like we can write this in Haskell directly, but we can't:
 -- the levity polymorphism checks defeat us. Note that `x` is a levity-
 -- polymorphic variable. So we must wire it in with a compulsory
 -- unfolding, like other levity-polymorphic primops.
 -- 
 -- The challenge is that UnsafeEquality is a GADT, and wiring in a GADT
 -- is *hard*: it has a worker separate from its wrapper, with all manner
 -- of complications. (Simon and Richard tried to do this. We nearly wept.

-- | @â‰‘@ is a two-parameter class that has instances for types @a@ and @b@ if
--      the compiler can infer that they have the same representation. This class
--      does not have regular instances; instead they are created on-the-fly during
--      type-checking. Trying to manually declare an instance of @Coercible@
--      is an error.
--
--      Nevertheless one can pretend that the following three kinds of instances
--      exist. First, as a trivial base-case:
--
--      @instance a â‰‘ a@
--
--      Furthermore, for every type constructor there is
--      an instance that allows to coerce under the type constructor. For
--      example, let @D@ be a prototypical type constructor (@data@ or
--      @newtype@) with three type arguments, which have roles @nominal@,
--      @representational@ resp. @phantom@. Then there is an instance of
--      the form
--
--      @instance b â‰‘ b\' â‡’ D a b c â‰‘ D a b\' c\'@
--
--      Note that the @nominal@ type arguments are equal, the
--      @representational@ type arguments can differ, but need to have a
--      @â‰‘@ instance themself, and the @phantom@ type arguments can be
--      changed arbitrarily.
--
--      The third kind of instance exists for every @newtype NT = MkNT T@ and
--      comes in two variants, namely
--
--      @instance a â‰‘ T => a â‰‘ NT@
--
--      @instance T â‰‘ b => NT â‰‘ b@
--
--      This instance is only usable if the constructor @MkNT@ is in scope.
--
--      If, as a library author of a type constructor like @Set a@, you
--      want to prevent a user of your module to write
--      @coerce âˆ· Set T â†’ Set NT@,
--      you need to set the role of @Set@\'s type parameter to @nominal@,
--      by writing
--
--      @type role Set nominal@

--
--          Ã— Casting between @â‰‘@ types
--
--          Ã— Casting between two types that have the same runtime representation even if their roles preclude a @â‰‘@ instance.
--
--         Other uses of @cast\#\#@ are undefined.  In particular, you should not use
--         @cast##\#@ to cast a T to an algebraic data type D, unless T is also
--         an algebraic data type.  For example, do not cast @Intâ†’Int@ to @Bool@, even if
--         you later cast that @Bool@ back to @Intâ†’Int@ before applying it.  The reasons
--         have to do with GHC\'s internal representation details (for the cognoscenti, data values

-- | Coerce a value from one type to another, bypassing the type-checker.
--
-- There are several legitimate ways to use 'unsafeCoerce':
--
--   1. To coerce e.g. @Int@ to @HValue@, put it in a list of @HValue@,
--      and then later coerce it back to @Int@ before using it.
--
--   2. To produce e.g. @(a+b) :~: (b+a)@ from @unsafeCoerce Refl@.
--      Here the two sides really are the same type -- so nothing unsafe is happening
--      -- but GHC is not clever enough to see it.
--
--   3. In @Data.Typeable@ we have
--
--      @
--        eqTypeRep :: forall k1 k2 (a :: k1) (b :: k2).
--                     TypeRep a -> TypeRep b -> Maybe (a :~~: b)
--        eqTypeRep a b
--          | sameTypeRep a b = Just (unsafeCoerce HRefl)
--          | otherwise       = Nothing
--      @
--
--      Here again, the @unsafeCoerce HRefl@ is safe, because the two types really
--      are the same  -- but the proof of that relies on the complex, trusted
--      implementation of @Typeable@.
--
--   4. The "reflection trick", which takes advantage of the fact that in
--      @class C a where { op :: ty }@, we can safely coerce between @C a@ and @ty@
--      (which have different kinds!) because it's really just a newtype.
--      Note: there is /no guarantee, at all/ that this behavior will be supported
--      into perpetuity.
--
--
--   For safe zero-cost coercions you can instead use the 'Data.Coerce.coerce' function from
--   "Data.Coerce".
