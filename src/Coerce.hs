-- | @Coercible@ is a two-parameter class that has instances for types @a@ and @b@ if
--      the compiler can infer that they have the same representation. This class
--      does not have regular instances; instead they are created on-the-fly during
--      type-checking. Trying to manually declare an instance of @Coercible@
--      is an error.
--
--      Nevertheless one can pretend that the following three kinds of instances
--      exist. First, as a trivial base-case:
--
--      @instance Coercible a a@
--
--      Furthermore, for every type constructor there is
--      an instance that allows to coerce under the type constructor. For
--      example, let @D@ be a prototypical type constructor (@data@ or
--      @newtype@) with three type arguments, which have roles @nominal@,
--      @representational@ resp. @phantom@. Then there is an instance of
--      the form
--
--      @instance Coercible b b\' => Coercible (D a b c) (D a b\' c\')@
--
--      Note that the @nominal@ type arguments are equal, the
--      @representational@ type arguments can differ, but need to have a
--      @Coercible@ instance themself, and the @phantom@ type arguments can be
--      changed arbitrarily.
--
--      The third kind of instance exists for every @newtype NT = MkNT T@ and
--      comes in two variants, namely
--
--      @instance Coercible a T => Coercible a NT@
--
--      @instance Coercible T b => Coercible NT b@
--
--      This instance is only usable if the constructor @MkNT@ is in scope.
--
--      If, as a library author of a type constructor like @Set a@, you
--      want to prevent a user of your module to write
--      @coerce :: Set T -> Set NT@,
--      you need to set the role of @Set@\'s type parameter to @nominal@,
--      by writing
--
--      @type role Set nominal@
